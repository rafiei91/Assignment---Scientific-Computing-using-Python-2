# Implementation

This folder contains 4 codes regarding the 4 implementation versions.

Each code, at first, define the required parameters ans then send the complex points to the related function (defined in /code_f/funcs.py).

Finally, after showing the execution time, the code makes a folder and saves the obtained data and the image there.
